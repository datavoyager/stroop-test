## Prompt 1
Make me a simple web app for the psychometric test called the stroop test with five colors. Show toggles at the start to toggle on or off the color fill on the answer buttons, and to toggle on or off the changing order of the answer buttons. Show the user an average response time score at the end when they make a mistake or finish. For every 10 correct answers pause show a screen explaining that the response time will reduce by one second. The maximum response time should start at 10 seconds and reduce by one second each round. Put a hard stop for 200 correct answers consecutively.
